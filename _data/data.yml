    summary: |
      Through the course "Software Technology", my goal is to understand how a system is organized and operates, as well as how to achieve interaction with it. To learn to collaborate, to solve my questions and to implement corresponding tasks through new software, such as linux. In addition, I would like to enhance / improve my programming knowledge, while through the educational videos, I intend to know the history of computer systems and how, in the end, the interface was done then.
